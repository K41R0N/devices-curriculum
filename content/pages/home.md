When we went to school, teachers asked us not to use Wikipedia. What we did was cite the Wikipedia sources instead. This is the root of how digital scholarship in the algorithm age should go.

You start with the things you know you have to learn, and you branch out as you actually develop an understanding and opinions to challenge. The goal is not comprehensive coverage, but depth. Each reading opens doors to further exploration.

This curriculum is a foundation, not a destination. It's designed to be used actively—engaging each text by asking: *How does this illuminate the DEVICES framework? What new dimensions does it reveal?*
